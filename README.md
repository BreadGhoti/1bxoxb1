# ðŸ¦´How it works

> Back-end : Google Sheets, AppScript

- A spreadsheet on my Google Sheet account stores all required information (date, username, message).

- Every 2 seconds browser sends calls backend function `getSpreadsheetData()`.

- `getSpreadsheetData()`, written in AppScript, sends a request to read spreadsheet using Sheets API.

- `getSpreadsheetData()` forwards data to the browser after parsing it.

- New messages since last call are added to HTML.


# âœ‹Limitations
- A maximum of 30 concurrent users.
- Google Sheet API allows at most 300 requests per minute.

- First you need a Google account.
- Create a spreadsheet on GoogleSheets. The name of the file is not important.
- Add the following header to your `Sheet1`.

## Create an appscript project
- Go to https://script.google.com/home then create a new appscript project. The project name is not important. 

- In your appscript project, manally create the following files.

- Fill these files with the content found in the `appscript` folder in my github repo.

- In `Code.gs` file, set `SPREADSHEET_URL` to the URL of your spreadsheet.

## Deploy project

- Deploy your project as a web app.
